# Database design #
There are 4 tables in our database. <br />
memory: Contains memory data. <br />
place: Contains place data. <br />
userinfo: Contains the registration information of users.<br />
response: Contains response data.<br />
<br />
## userinfo ##
CREATE TABLE userinfo <br />
( <br />
id int NOT NULL AUTO\_INCREMENT, <br />
nameinfo VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, <br />
email TEXT character set utf8  NOT NULL, <br />
passwordinfo TEXT character set utf8, <br />
PRIMARY KEY (id) <br />
); <br />
<br />
id is the primary key that uniquely identifies a row. When a row is inserted, this field is auto-incremented. nameinfo is the user name of the user. email is the email address the user has provided at registration. passwordinfo is the password the user has provided at registration.
<br />
## place ##
CREATE TABLE place<br />
(<br />
place\_name TEXT character set utf8  NOT NULL, <br />
place\_id VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL, <br />
latitude double NOT NULL, <br />
longtitude double NOT NULL, <br />
address\_components TEXT character set utf8, <br />
PRIMARY KEY (place\_id) <br />
); <br />
<br />
place\_name is the common name for a place. place\_id is the unique identifier for a place that is generated by GoogleMaps API. latitude is the latitude component of the exact geographical coordinates of the place. longtitude is the longitude component of the exact geographical coordinates of the place. address\_components contains information about the address of the place such as street name, city name etc.
<br />
## memory ##
CREATE TABLE memory <br />
(<br />
memory\_id int NOT NULL AUTO\_INCREMENT,<br />
place\_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, <br />
title TEXT character set utf8, <br />
author TEXT character set utf8 NOT NULL, <br />
image\_url TEXT character set utf8, <br />
content TEXT character set utf8 NOT NULL, <br />
tags TEXT character set utf8, <br />
mem\_date DATETIME NOT NULL, <br />
active boolean NOT NULL, <br />
PRIMARY KEY (memory\_id) <br />
); <br />

memory\_id is the primary key that uniquely identifies a memory. When a new memory is added, this field is auto-incremented. place\_id is the unique identifier for a place that is generated by GoogleMaps API. title is the title of the memory. author is the user name of the user who has created the memory (nameinfo in userinfo table). image\_url is the path of the location on the file system where the photos added by the user for that memory are saved. content is the body of the memory entered by the user. tags are keywords about the memory that the user enters so the memory can be found when searched with that tag. mem\_date is the date of the memory. active indicates if the memory is active or not. The field place\_id in this table is a foreign key that references the place\_id column in the place table.
<br />
## response ##
CREATE TABLE response <br />
( <br />
response\_id int NOT NULL, <br />
user TEXT character set utf8  NOT NULL, <br />
memory\_id int, <br />
response\_date DATETIME NOT NULL, <br />
PRIMARY KEY (response\_id), <br />
FOREIGN KEY (memory\_id) REFERENCES memory(memory\_id) <br />
); <br />
<br />
response\_id is the primary key that uniquely identifies a response. It is auto-incremented when a new row is inserted. user is the email address of the user who has entered the response. memory\_id is the id of the memory in question. response\_date is the date time when the response was created. In this table the column memory\_id is a foreign key that references the memory\_id column in the memory table.
