# Customer Requests #

Details below include customer requests and possible implementation actions, we can refer to this page and create another Implementations Page with references from here to create the the RSD doc ?

## October 13, 2014 ##

These requests have to be discussed before taking actions on implementations, alternatives are welcome

1. Search queries should yield relevant results and if multiple memories exists in the same place, they should all share same tags (For discussion: are we filtering by and or or ?)

2. Each memory can have a memory description, also other people can "Reply" and add comments to other peoples' memories.

3. Predefined date presets may be segregated and processed (ie. today, yesterday, last year, last month, specific date or date picker). That can also be a date picker which can accept coarse input as well as fine.

4. Memories can also be happy, informative, sad etc.. We can add a limited number of choices (This may require to be controllable from the moderator page) and they will be able to choose from those and we can filter it as a tag

Memories can have two line tags
- Line 1: User Created Tags
- Line 2: Emotion Describing Tags

If a search query is received, we can show the results for it, and the client side can have all the tags attached to it, and the client can see all the inactive tags as well, and can click and see other replies and/or entries associated with it,

**OR, instead of 4**

5. We can search in a search bar for location, and search for another tag for relational mapping. Also, the replies under comments should be chosen from a limited number of choices, not free text (to avoid moderation load)

6. Tags should be either in location or description
