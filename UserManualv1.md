Living History application is used for entering/viewing/responding to memories.

The application has 2 areas of usage:  1. Web client   2. Android client

The system contains a standard authentication system where users can register, login and connect to the system.

•	A new user will have to first determine a password and then input his/her mail address.

•	An existing user will input password and mail address



## 3.	Landing Page ##

Once a user is logged in to the system, the first screen he/she will see is the landing page. It consists of several features required to perform various tasks. Those tasks are as following:



•	Search Box allows the user to search for memories and/or locations for memories

•	Main Map shows all input memories in specific places of the memories as pins on the map. A pin may contain a single memory, as well as multiple entries.

•	Add Location allows the user to either (i) click on the map and thereby add a location by pinpointing place on the map, or (ii) to search for a place on the map using the search box and automatically locate said location. Once the desired location is found, the user can click the add button next to the location and proceed to enter details of the memory.

•	Filter Memories opens a filtering screen that allows the user to either (i) perform a search via entering various texts and/or (ii) defining a time interval using the slider on the bottom.



## 4.	Add New Memory ##

Submitting memory contains all the possible features one might need for defining a specific memory with both visual and location-based details.



•	Memory Title is the short sentence description for the summary of the memory. It is defined by the memories owner and is shared as such on the system between users.

•	Tags are specific keywords described by the user to conjoin the memory with various similar others. Tags are defined by the user and cannot be changed later on.

•	Date Picker allows three predefined time slots to be chosen by the users to define the memory’s time with various precision. The preset times are:

o	Year

o	Month

o	Day

•	Memory Description describes the text field where users can enter their memories in detail and may also opt to include visual material using the attach button.
